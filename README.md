# RadioButton, SearchBar, and SwipeView in .NET MAUI

## What is RadioButton in .NET MAUI?

The **RadioButton** element in .NET MAUI is used to allow users to select a single option from a set of mutually exclusive options. RadioButtons are commonly grouped together, and only one option can be selected at a time within the group. In .NET MAUI, RadioButtons can be grouped using the `GroupName` property.

### Key Features of RadioButton

- **Single Selection**: RadioButtons allow **only one** option to be selected from a group, providing clear user input for exclusive choices.
- **GroupName**: Multiple RadioButtons can be grouped by assigning them the same `GroupName` value, ensuring only one button in the group can be selected.
- **CheckedChanged Event**: The `CheckedChanged` event allows developers to react when a RadioButton’s state changes, such as when it’s selected or deselected.

### Example of RadioButton

```xml
<StackLayout Padding="10">
    <Label Text="Select a Language:" FontSize="Large" />
    <RadioButton GroupName="Languages" Content="C#" />
    <RadioButton GroupName="Languages" Content="Java" />
    <RadioButton GroupName="Languages" Content="Python" />
</StackLayout>
```
In this example:
- **RadioButtons** are grouped using `GroupName="Languages"`, ensuring only one language can be selected at a time.
- The `Content` property defines the label for each option.

### When to Use RadioButton
- Use **RadioButtons** when you need users to **select one option** from a set of mutually exclusive choices, such as **selecting a language** or **choosing a payment method**.
